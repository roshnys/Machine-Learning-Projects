# End game prediction with Machine Learning (Connect-4)

The idea of the project is to perform Classification on the dataset which contains all legal positions of the connect-4 game which non of the players has won, yet. The goal of the classification is to try to predict the end game from the current position. There were pretty good results.

## Dataset

## Code

The code used in this project is inside **connect_four_classification.ipynb**. In this project I have tested many Machine Learning classification algorithms, from the Tree Classifier to simple knn.

## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:

`ipython notebook connect_four_classification.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook connect_four_classification.ipynb`
