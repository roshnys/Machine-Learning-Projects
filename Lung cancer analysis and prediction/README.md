# Lung Cancer prediction with Machine Learning

I have tried to recreated results from Hong and Young testing on this dataset. They have used KNN and RDA algorithm for this dataset and achieved 53.1%/77% and 62.5% respectively. In the my testings I have achieved much higher score.

## Code

The code used in this project is inside **lung_cancer_classification.ipynb**.

## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:

`ipython notebook lung_cancer_classification.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook lung_cancer_classification.ipynb`
