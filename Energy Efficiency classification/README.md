# Energy efficiency with Machine Learning

Angeliki Xifara who created dataset, had an idea to test Energy efficiency in buildings, in other words heating and cooling load. In this project I have implemented custom and sklearn version of Support Vector Classifier to predict the Energy efficiency based on the data provided.

## Dataset

Dataset used in this project can be found [here]( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency).

## Install

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supported Python version
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Python version used in this project: 3.5+

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Libraries used

> *  [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) 0.18.0
> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.10.4
> *  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) 1.5.1
> *  [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 0.17.1

## Code

The main code used in this project is inside **energy_classification.ipynb**. Another part of the code, which is optional, is inside **naive_b_custom.py** located in the same folder. This file contains Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm wrote from scratch, if you want to learn how it works examine the file. :)

## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:

`ipython notebook energy_classification.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook energy_classification.ipynb`
